# MyIdeaPool


I am supposed to build a REST API as mentioned in one assignment spec.

I am supposed to use Java to build this backend.

I used this evaluation as an opportunity to learn SparkJava instead of using Spring or SpringBoot.

SparkJava is a Micro Framework built on the same lines of Nodejs.

I used Sql2O another small library to run direct queries on JDBC complaint databases. It is very fast (2nd only to resultsets.) compared to other ORMs.

I have deployed this application on DigitalOcean droplet. http://159.89.148.225:8080

I used the cm-quiz gem to test this app. It looks like this.

C:\Users\Krishna Chaitanya P>cm-quiz test --endpoint=http://159.89.148.225:8080
Start test http://159.89.148.225:8080
please wait...
endpoint: http://159.89.148.225:8080
score: 100.0
7 examples, 0 failures

P.S : DigitalOcean droplets are easy targets for hackers, so I see droplets going down frequently. If you see that url is down mail me at krishnachaitannya366@gmail.com
so that I can bring it up again.
